Album tracker application with Backbone.js
==================

Trying out Backbone.js by building an application to track my music collection.

TODO:

- Filters are currently mutually exclusive, need to figure out a way to be able to use both filters.
- Similarly, the filter router URL thing isn't done very neatly either.
